**Usage**

I don't run a web server on any of my machines, and this relies on TypeKit for fonts so the easiest workaround was to set-up a quick Vagrant VM, even though it's all static files. 

To use fire up the VM and then navigate to [10.6.6.6](http://10.6.6.6) in your web browser. 

	cd /path/to/project
	vagrant up
